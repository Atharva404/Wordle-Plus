# Wordle-Plus
This is my attempt at recreating the famous internet game: Wordle. Unlike the original game, my attempt will have multiple features such as a shuffle button where you can get a new word upon completion and a custom dictionary where users can input their own words.

In this project I learned how to incorporate bootstrap elements into our own workflow. This can be seen from the navbars. I also learned how to work my way around an error through console.log() to depict where my code is not functioning. This debugging method saved me so much time. 

Struggles:
* **Problem:** I stuggled on how to show the messages on screen for a certain amount of time. 

* Solution: By using 'document.getElementById()' I was able to retrieve the element and alter              the properties to my needs. I also figured out the benefits of setTimeout()
        
* **Problem:** How to optimize the light and dark theme without creating two seperate html/css/javascript files
  
*  Solution: By using a toggle switch for the transition between light and dark mode and ':root'           to host all the different colors, I was able to make the smooth transition between light and            dark mode without the need of duplicate files. 

* **Problem:** How to incorporate bootstrap navbar
  
*  Solution: This was my first time using bootstrap and incorproating into my very first html/css/javascript project. I eventually figured out how to use the CDN for bootstrap and link the files onto my html website through stack overflow.

Learned:
* I learned how usefull websites such as stack overflow are to get information to solve our problems. Our simplest issues can be solved with a quick google search which can save us so much time.
* Since this was my very first project, I understood how and why Javascript is incorporated within web development and how it is a vital programming language.
* Learned how to read debug messages and how to use console.log() to narrow down the source of my error.
* Upon reserarching, I found this website that gives the hex codes for colors: coolors.co
* I learned how to use animations to flip the tiles for the letters. I thought this was very cool since this was my first time working with the animations. I also used clickEvent methods to change the color properities of the keyboard. 
* Understood how to connect code with html and manipulate the attributes of texts and buttons to get the desired output through javascript.
* Another thing that I learned and thought was cool was how we can change the visibility of messages and buttons on this website through the styling feature within javascript. 'ptag.style.visibility = "visible";'
